#### Project description:

Players roll the dice, you have to earn at least 20 points to win.

I've added my own features to the game:
1. Equal number of players' roll dices is the second condition of winning the game
2. During your turn you can click one of the special buttons:
    - Double or nothing button - you have 50% chances to double the points but also 50% chances to earn 0 points during the roll
    - Flying cow button - you have 75% chances to reset opponent's points but also 25% chances to reset your own points
3. Cow animation :wink:
